				<p><strong>Access Granted</strong> is a private, members-only posting platform where conversations stay meaningful and secure. Inside the clubhouse, members know who’s talking — but from the outside, the posts remain anonymous.</p>
				<p>Built as part of The Odin Project, our mission is to practice privacy-first development while building trust-based community tools.</p>
